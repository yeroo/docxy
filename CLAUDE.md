## DOCX Bidi Rendering

- Keep `docxcore` dependency-free. It exposes `RenderOptions::bidi` and the
  `BidiProjector` trait, but it must not depend on `unicode-bidi`.
- Keep `unicode-bidi` in `docxy`. Terminal `docxy` passes the projector into
  rendering so wrapped DOCX lines are projected into Unicode bidi visual order.
- Editor storage, copy/export, save offsets, undo/redo, and automation offsets
  remain logical. Visual arrow movement, Home/End, vertical movement, clicks, and
  drags use `LineMap` visual caret stops.
- Hosts that do not provide a projector, including the current wasm-backed Offxy
  editors, should pass `bidi: None` and will render DOCX text in identity order.
- The editable-HTML page (`htmlbundle/web/`) renders DOCX as DOM from
  `docx_doc`, not as projected grid lines, so the browser does bidi itself;
  its selection maps to logical editor offsets through `data-o` segments.
